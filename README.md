•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  o	The Project was to organize and count how many times an item is bought in a single day. It was solving a problem of the “unknown” for the customer and allowing them to use that data for a better flow in their store.
  
•	What did you do particularly well?
  o	For this project, I had less guidance on how to organize the code. I chose to spilt the code up into three different files for OOP. Allowing for better ease of use and editing in the future versions.
  
•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  o	To hance the code, I could add more classes for different categories throughout the whole store. As well if we receive the data on times of purchase, we could include when the store sells the most during certain time periods. 
  
•	Which pieces of code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  o	I found it difficult to get the class working at attended. I use the lessons provided in the class as examples and google questions here and there.
  
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  o	The greatest transferable knowledge I have is understanding OOP and applying that to work and future projects.
